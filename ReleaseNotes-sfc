NIC partitioning, SR-IOV and PF-IOV modes on SFN7XXX/8XXX adapters
------------------------------------------------------------------
This release of the Solarflare Linux Net driver supports NIC partitioning
(multiple PFs) and SR-IOV (VFs).

See "Solarflare Server Adapter User's Guide" SF-103837-CD Issue >=12
available from https://support.solarflare.com for more detailed information
on setting up NIC partitioning, SR-IOV or PF-IOV modes.

Some additional details as well as known issues are documented below:
General:
  ~ NIC partitioning/SRIOV/PF-IOV features require sfutils >=v4.3.0.1010 which
    contains adapter firmware v4.2.1.1014 and firmware-variant=full-feature
    (setup with sfboot)
  ~ Please note that Hybrid SR-IOV support for SFN5XXX|6XXX drivers is now
    deprecated. Please use an older driver to continue using this feature.
  ~ Link control (e.g. setting pause frames with ethtool and controlling MTU) is
    only available on the first PF on each port; (this is referred to as "PF0"
    or the "primary PF")
  ~ Only link control functions have the full MAC statistics available to them
    (via ethtool -S). All statistics that come from the MAC are now prefixed
    "port_" as they refer to a single physical network port.
    All other functions have statistics which show the number of packets and
    bytes both received and transmitted by that function, classified into
    unicast, multicast and broadcast traffic.
  ~ MTD partitions are only exposed from PF0 on each port, hence the utilities
    sfupdate, sfboot and sfkey need to be run where they have access to PF0.
  ~ It is now possible to identify which physical port an interface is bound to.
    See /sys/class/net/<interface>/device/physical_port (note this is zero
    based whereas the identifiers printed on the adapter brackets are one based)
  ~ The driver supports the use of shared RSS indirection tables, after the
    16 unique hardware RSS indirection tables entries have been consumed.
  ~ In order for active-backup bonding to work, the slave interface normally
    takes the MAC address of the master interface. Only PF0 is allowed to
    change its MAC address. Therefore for this to work with other functions it
    is necessary to set "sfboot mac-spoofing=enabled". An alternative is to
    set the bonding module option "fail_over_mac" and allow the gratuitous ARP
    to inform the other link partners of the change in MAC address.
  ~ At this time PTP will only work with the PF0 on each port and will
    not work with a VF.

NIC partitioning support on SFN7XXX/8XXX adapters:
  ~ The sfc.ko driver will bind to multiple PFs on the same physical adapter
    port and create a network interface for each PF.
  ~ Configure with "sfboot switch-mode=partitioning pf-count=X" and cold reboot
    the server if warned to do so.
  ~ If using NIC partitioning in the same layer2 broadcast domain you may
    need the kernel parameter "arp_ignore=2" as linux will reply to ARP
    on any interface. This might cause traffic to go over unexpected interfaces.
  ~ If using NIC partitioning with VLANs all PFs must be on a unique VLAN
    (which can include VLAN 0). Traffic that is sent/received from this PF will
    have VLAN tags transparently inserted/stripped by the adapter. A single PF
    on each port can be on VLAN0 where it will both receive and transmit
    untagged traffic.
  ~ Configure NIC partitioning with VLANs using
    "sfboot pf-vlans=<VLAN>,<VLAN>..."
  ~ Do not use LACP bonding modes when using NIC partitioning as the LACP
    partner (switch) will not be aware of the partitioning.
  ~ The driver parameter "num_vis" is now more important. This controls how many
    extra VIs (RX/TX/event rings) are allocated for the use of onload on each
    PF. If not using onload you may wish to set "num_vis=0" so that there
    are no false resource limitations when using multiple PFs.
  ~ When PF0 is put into promiscuous mode it will receive traffic for its own
    MAC address as well as any other incoming traffic that does not match
    another PF's MAC address. For other PFs there is no change in received
    traffic if the interface is put into promiscuous mode.

SR-IOV support on SFN7XXX/8XXX adapters:
  ~ The sfc.ko driver will bind to all VFs and create network interfaces.
  ~ Configure with "sfboot switch-mode=sriov pf-count=1 vf-count=X" and cold
    reboot the server if warned to do so.
  ~ RHEL6.5 and RHEL7 are supported for the host/hypervisor OS.
  ~ It is possible to consume the VFs using these KVM/libirt modes:
     - network hostdev (VF passed into the VM; migration is only possible if
                        the VF is hot-unplugged)
     - direct-passthrough  (macvtap interface used over the VF and virtio-net
                            driver used in the VM guest)
  ~ Note that VFs will initially be assigned random MAC addresses, but libvirt
    (and ip link) can override the MAC address.
  ~ A VF in a VM will be unable to set its own MAC address. See the item on
    active-backup bonding.
  ~ To enable VFs (for RHEL6.5 and RHEL 7)
      echo <num vfs> > /sys/class/ethX/device/sriov_numvfs
  ~ To enable VFs on older operating systems set the sfc.ko module parameter
    "max_vfs". If set to a single integer this is the number of VFs to enable
    and will apply to all PFs. If you wish to configure this to be a different
    value for each PF set this to a comma separated list.
  ~ Please ensure that you enable all BIOS settings that refer to virtualization
    and SR-IOV (note there might be several e.g. SRIOV, IOMMU, VT, VT-x, VT-d,
    IO virtualization)
  ~ Solarflare recommends setting "pci=realloc" as a kernel parameter
    (e.g. in /boot/grub/grub.conf). This allows the kernel to reprogram the
    initial BIOS PCI apertures in case PCI aperture space for the VFs is not
    assigned by the BIOS.
  ~ To view which VFs are associated with which PFs and the VF MAC addresses
    please use "ip link show"
  ~ A PF put into promiscuous mode will not see the traffic to/from a VF.
  ~ A VF put into promiscuous mode will not see any additional traffic.
  ~ Setting VF MAC/VLANs/link state is possible via the ip command
    (or libvirt configuration). From "ip link help"
      "ip link set { dev DEVICE}
         [ vf NUM [ mac LLADDR ]
                  [ vlan VLANID ]
                  [ state { auto | enable | disable} ] ]"
  ~ Setting VF spoofcheck/rate/qos (e.g. via the ip command) is not supported
    at this time.

SR-IOV with NIC partitioning mode support on SFN7XXX/8XXX adapters:
  ~ This mode offers partitioning of the adapter. Each partition is on a unique
    VLAN and within this layer2 broadcast domain there is switching on the
    adapter between the PF and VFs.
  ~ This support is currently considered EXPERIMENTAL i.e. all features are
    present, but there has only been limited testing. Solarflare will support
    the use of this feature in a test environment, but does not recommend use
    in a production environment until this feature becomes GA.
    Note that both SR-IOV and NIC partitioning as individual features are both
    considered GA quality.
  ~ Ensure you are using adapter firmware >= v4.4.2.1011
  ~ It is necessary to configure NIC partitioning with unique VLANs in this mode
  ~ Configure with:
    "sfboot switch-mode=partitioning-with-sriov \
       pf-count=X  pf-vlans=<VLAN>[,<VLAN>]... \
       vf-count=Y"
    and cold reboot the server if warned to do so.

PF-IOV mode support on SFN7XXX/8XXX adapters:
  ~ This mode offers switching between PFs. Use this mode where a server does
    not support SR-IOV (otherwise please use SR-IOV mode as this provides up-to
    240VFs versus only 16PFs)
  ~ Configure with "sfboot switch-mode=pfiov pf-count=X" and cold reboot the
    server if warned to do so.
  ~ In RHEL7 passing through a PCI function uses the new VFIO mechanism.
    Due to a missing capability flag on SFN7XXX/8XXX hardware, VFIO will only
    allow all PFs to be passed into a guest together. This will be addressed
    with a kernel quirk.


Known issues with the platform (KVM/libvirt/kernel)
---------------------------------------------------
  ~ libvirt direct-bridged mode on-top of a VF is not supported. Please use
    libvirt direct-bridged mode over a PF or direct-passthrough mode with VFs.
Issue 46876:
  ~ Multicast does not work in libvirt direct-passthrough mode.
    This is because the multicast address list is not propagated to the network
    interface below the macvtap driver. Without this the sfc.ko driver is unable
    to program the adapter switch to efficiently replicate multicast traffic to
    only the subscribed functions. Solarflare will work with upstream to find a
    solution to this issue.
Issue 47742:
  ~ IPv6 traffic does not pass in direct-bridged and direct-passthrough modes.
    In direct-passthrough mode multicast neighbour solicitation fails as per the
    previous point.
    In direct-bridged mode this is because an interface calculates an IPv6 link
    address based on its MAC address. There will be a neighbour solicitation
    multicast filter in the host, but when a global address is assigned in the
    VM guest, a multicast filter corresponding to the new global address is not
    inserted in the host because macvtap doesn't propagate this information.
Issue 46948:
  ~ The macvtap driver does not propagate the link state from the real network
    interface. This means that it is not possible to use bonded interfaces that
    use link state detection (miimon). Instead please use ARP probes. This
    affects libvirt direct-bridged and direct-passthrough modes.
Issue 47490:
  ~ Bad interactions can occur with NetworkManager scripts when it sees
    new VFs with random MAC addresses. Alternatively use the older networking
    service/scripts.
Issue 50308:
  ~ For RHEL 7.0 disabling GRO after passing traffic is unsafe, and can lead to
    a kernel NULL pointer deference. This is believed to be addressed by Redhat
    in RHEL 7.1. This will only happen when LRO is also disabled. For
    configurations that disable GRO and LRO, please disable GRO after the driver
    is loaded, but before the interface is brought up.
Issue 50873:
  ~ Changing the MTU across the page size (4K for x86) on a network team in
    RHEL 7.0 can cause a hang. As a workaround please change the MTU of the
    component interfaces of the team before creating it. This is fixed in
    RHEL 7.1


Known Issues with Solarflare driver/firmware
--------------------------------------------
SF-119015-KI / Issue 72914:
 ~ [SFN7xxx series firmware only].
   There is an issue when using MCFW where a transmit queue using TSO may lockup
   and cause a NETDEV watchdog.
 ~ In the default configuration of "pf-count=1" (where there is no NIC
   partitioning) the NETDEV watchdog will occur on TX queue >=31, this will
   only be used if there are more than 32 logical CPUs in the machine, or if the
   "rss_cpus" module parameter is explicitly set.
 ~ As a workaround please set the module parameter to at most "rss_cpus=31".
 ~ As a fix please update adapter firmware using the "sfutils" package from
   https://support.solarflare.com to MCFW >= v6.2.7.1000

Issue 50868:
  ~ If using a SFN7142Q adapter with adapter firmware v4.1.0.6742 and running
    sfupdate, after the update the two network interfaces from the second QSFP+
    port will be in a disabled state. Please reload the driver to correct this.
    This issue has been resolved in adapter firmware >=v4.1.1.1022.


Changelog
---------

### v4.12.2.1014 -- update release for OpenOnload-201710
[General changes]
 ~ Kernel compatibility for upstream 4.15, 4.16-rc5 and RHEL 7.5.

 ~ Increase the number of multicast filters used before reverting to the
   'multicast all' filter. In response to customer feedback the maximum number
   of multicast filters inserted has been increased from 256 to 512. Above
   that the individual filters will still be replaced with a 'multicast all'
   filter.

SF-119883-KI / Issue 78131:
 ~ A race condition in the MCDI (driver<=>adapter communication) state machine
   could result in stack data being accessed from a different thread after it
   had gone out of scope. This would result in invalid addresses being read or
   a hard lockup, both with efx_mcdi_rpc_completer and __wake_up in the call
   stack. A similar race (not observed in use) was identified and fixed in the
   PTP/MCDI interaction.

### v4.12.2.1006 -- update release for OpenOnload-201710
[General changes]
 ~ GCC 7.2 introduces additional warnings related to potential string
   truncation. The warnings generated by the drivers are not causes for concern,
   since the actual possible numerical range is small; however, the format
   string checking isn't aware of the actual numerical range. Format strings
   have been updated and types changed to prevent warnings.
 ~ Kernel compatibility for upstream 4.14, 4.15-rc6.

Issue 74885:
 ~ A race condition in the MCDI (driver<=>adapter communication) state machine
   could result in cleanup code being run twice, resulting in various errors
   with efx_mcdi_process_cleanup_list in the call stack.

Issue 75614:
 ~ During a link flap caused by a switch the driver would log link up/down
   messages at an excessive rate. These messages are now rate limited.

SF-119179-KI / Issue 75087:
 ~ Interrupts were wrongly named "<interface>-xdp" instead of "<interface>-tx"
   when using separate_tx_channels mode.

Issue 73384:
 ~ Adapter license checks must be completed before the driver attempts to read
   any capability flags.

### v4.12.1.1021 -- GA release (SF17.2)
SF-119052-KI / Issue 74628:
 ~ Fix "rx event arrived on queue xx labeled as queue yy" that could disable
   the interface.
 ~ This could only occur with:
    * >32 RXQs in-use (i.e. >32 logical CPUs or rss_cpus module parameter set).
    * sfboot msix-limit of 64 or above (a non-default configuration).
    * SFC net driver v4.12.1.1016 (i.e. OpenOnload-201710).

Issue 74078:
 ~ Remove warning when expiring an ARFS filter that has been replaced with a
   higher priority filter (such as an ethtool ntuple filter).


### v4.12.1.1016 -- release with OpenOnload-201710
[General changes]
 ~ Rework of MCDI (driver<=>adapter communication) state machine (to better
   support long running background operations on the adapter).
 ~ Increase maximum number of channels (as determined by the rss_cpus module
   parameter) from 32 to 64. This allows more RX and TX queues which is useful
   on systems with large numbers of cores. Note that most NICs will have a
   default MSI-X interrupt count limit of 32. This can be increased using
   "sfboot msix-limit=<n>".
 ~ Support configuring a 2-tuple RSS hash for UDP. This ensures that a UDP flow
   always hashes to the same CPU regardless of how many IP fragments the UDP
   packet spans,
   To configure a 2-uple of IP source and destination address:
    # ethtool -N <interface> rx-flow-hash udp4 sd
   To confirm which fields are used for the RSS hash:
    # ethtool -n <interface> rx-flow-hash udp4
   To use the The default is a 4-way hash:
    # ethtool -N <interface> rx-flow-hash udp4 sdfn

[PTP changes]
 ~ Increase the frequency adjustment range supported by the net driver to +-10%
   and create mechanism for sfptpd to detect this.

[XDP preview]
 ~ This release includes experimental driver support for XDP (Express Data
   Path). XDP is a kernel feature that allows eBPF programs to be run on
   incoming packets before they are passed to the rest of the network stack.
   The program can modify the packet and instruct the driver to:
    - accept the packet
    - drop the packet
    - transmit the packet on the same interface
    - transmit the packet on a different interface
 ~ Support for the various features depends on different upstream kernel
   versions. Please check XDP support is available in your kernel:
    - Support for drop and TX appeared in linux v4.8.
    - Support for redirect is appearing in linux v4.14.
 ~ For XDP transmit, additional transmit queues are used by the driver. To
   avoid increasing the resource utilization in general use, this is NOT
   enabled by default. To enable allocation of the necessary resources, the
   module parameter "xdp_alloc_tx_resources=1" should be specified when
   loading the driver. The intention is for a future release of this driver
   to allow such resources to be allocated dynamically, avoiding the need
   for this load time configuration; as such, it is likely that this module
   parameter will be removed in a future release.

Issue 73931:
 ~ Check structure pointer is valid before use in debugfs.
 ~ This was seen to cause a NULL pointer dereference in debugfs access only if
   certain parts of driver initialization had failed. There is no issue if the
   driver successfully creates a network interface.

Issue 73700:
 ~ Candidate fix for "kernel BUG at lib/dynamic_queue_limits.c:26!" by adding
   memory barriers to address race between netdev_tx_sent and
   netdev_tx_completed.

Issue 73384:
 ~ [SFN8000 series] No licenses available if the sfc driver loaded immediately
   after firmware restart.
 ~ This could only be triggered with "ethtool -t enp1s0f0; onload_tool reload"

Issue 73143:
 ~ Fixed reading of ef10 data on non-ef10 NIC (i.e. SFN5000 or SFN6000 series)
 ~ This was detected using KASAN by Stefano Brivio at Redhat:
      BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in efx_mcdi_mac_stats 

Issue 73104:
 ~ Only report link down if it was previously up.
 ~ This can occur as the adapter firmware may report changes to PCS states
   while the overall link state is still down.

Issue 73085:
 ~ [PTP] Erroneous PTP offset sometimes reported on multi CPU-package machines,
   believed to be caused by QPI routing.
 ~ Improve sample selection by using the one which is closest to the average
   of good samples.

Issue 72543:
 ~ [onload] Increase event queue 0 allowance for driverlink events. This had
   been seen to lead to the following errors on TX queue 0:
     MCDI request was completed without an event
     TX queue 0 spurious TX completion id 1480

Issue 72328:
 ~ Fix possible overflow of unicast address list. e.g. by configuration of a
   32nd macvlan interface all on the same network interface. The error was of
   the form:
     WARNING: at driver/linux_net/ef10.c:7032 efx_ef10_filter_insert_addr_list+0x4d2/0x510 [sfc]()

Issue 72220:
  ~ [32bit PHC support]. Fix bug in efx_phc_gettime32() that returns junk time.
  ~ This only affects systems without 64bit PHC support e.g. some SLES11
    (kernel 3.0.101) 

Issue 71931:
 ~ Correct endianness of filters debugfs output.

Issue 70902:
 ~ [SFN5000 and SFN6000 series] Fix panic in efx_ethtool_get_regs() from
   "ethtool -d".

Issue 68849:
 ~ Fix "hwmon_device_register() is deprecated" warning seen in Ubuntu 17.04

Issue 68040:
 ~ [PTP + SFN8000 series] Report correct TX timestamp corrections for
     (a) normal data path used for PTP transmit.
     (b) general TX timestamps from the MAC.

Issue 67150:
 ~ Reduce race condition waiting for ethtool -t offline self-test to complete.

Issue 66860:
 ~ Correct VF handling when "ethtool -t offline" self-test is run on any
   privileged PF.

Issue 63057:
 ~ [SFN8000 series] fallback to default speeds if none advertised.
 ~ There can be an issue getting a link on SFN8000 series adapters after a
   RHEL 6.8/7.3 in-box driver has been loaded first.

Issue 62723:
 ~ Remove PCIe FLR after "Failed to acquire MCDI state" as this does not seem
   to improve driver robustness.

Issue 58792:
 ~ Fix WARNINGs on driver unload for (debug) kernels with the option
   DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE enabled.

Issue 56902:
 ~ Ensure filter is removed during an MC reboot (e.g. sfupdate) when onload is
   being used. This has been seen to cause the following errors:
     [onload] tcp_helper_endpoint_clear_filters: [0:28]  
     sfc 0000:01:00.0 enp1s0f0: MC command 0x8a inlen 108 failed rc=-22 (raw=0) 
   and
     [onload] __oof_manager_addr_del: 0:79 CLEAR TCP 172.16.132.67:35769
     sfc 0000:01:00.0 enp1s0f0: MC command 0x8a inlen 108 failed rc=-22 (raw=0) 

Issue 48050:
 ~ Handle adapter VPD data residing at offsets greater than 512bytes in PCI
   config space.
 ~ This resulted in the message "Unable to read VPD"

[Stratus ftServer support] - Note these issues only affect PCI hot-plug cases
Issue 68343:
 ~ Fix deadlock between efx_channel_reassign_irq and efx_irq_notify.
 ~ Could also be hit when running "ethtool -C" and "ethtool -G" in a loop.


### v4.10.7.1004 -- Update release for EOL5
Issue 75470:
 ~ Error handling in the transmit path in efx_dequeue_buffers could cause a
   null pointer dereference. This error handling has not been hit in any known
   production environment.

Issue 73143:
 ~ Fixed reading of ef10 data on non-ef10 NIC (i.e. SFN5000 or SFN6000 series)
 ~ This was detected using KASAN by Stefano Brivio at Redhat:
      BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in efx_mcdi_mac_stats

Issue 72328:
 ~ Fix possible overflow of unicast address list. e.g. by configuration of a
   32nd macvlan interface all on the same network interface. The error was of
   the form:
     WARNING: at driver/linux_net/ef10.c:7032 efx_ef10_filter_insert_addr_list+0x4d2/0x510 [sfc]()

### v4.10.7.1001 -- Update release for EOL5
Issue 51996:
 ~ Kernel compatibility fix for early RHEL 6.x releases. WQ_MEM_RECLAIM was
   not defined.

### v4.10.7.1000 -- Update release to match EO5 release
[General changes]
 ~ Kernel compatibility for RHEL 7.4
 ~ Change to newer API to avoid the following deprecation warning:
     hwmon_device_register() is deprecated.
     Please convert the driver to use hwmon_device_register_with_info().
 ~ Expose the sfc_pps work queue in sysfs so that CPU affinity can be
   controlled.


### v4.10.6.1002 -- Update release (SF17.1)
[General changes]:
 ~ Kernel compatibility extended to Linux 4.11.
 ~ Adjust to core networking busy polling support available in Linux 4.11.

[XDP preview]
 ~ Preview of RX side XDP support.
 ~ This allows for RX filtering to use the DROP target and for RX packet
   modification (e.g. decapsulation).
 ~ Additionally header expansion is supported (e.g. encapsulation).

Issue 69569:
 ~ Fix timestamp being 1s behind if the minor nanosecond timestamp happened to
   be exactly on 0.


### v4.10.4.1005 -- GA release to match openonload-201606-u1.2
[General changes]
 ~ Kernel compatability extended to Linux 4.10.

Issue 68158:
 ~ Fix driver build without PTP support.

Issue 67994:
 ~ Fix for pps_get_ts() only returning microsecond resolution with RHEL 7.2.
 ~ (Note this did not affect other RHEL 7.X releases).
 ~ This would affect the PTP convergence accuracy that is achieved.


### v4.10.4.1000 -- GA release for ESXi adding support for SFN8542 adapters.
[General VMware ESXi 5.5, 6.0 and 6.5 support]
 ~ GA support for ESXi and SFN8542 Solarflare adapters.
 ~ Support VXLAN acceleration for ESXi.


### v4.10.0.1025 -- GA release for overlays support on SFN8XXX adapters.
[General changes]
 ~ Improve error message when a TX queue times out to give more information.

Issue 66936:
 ~ Ensure the packet prefix is available to timestamping.
 ~ Without this patch invalid memory accesses to addresses ending 0xfb
   will be seen in __efx_rx_skb_attach_timestamp() if GRO or LRO is being used.

Issue 66058:
 ~ Clear napi_hash related state when copying channels.
 ~ This is only seen on driver unload when >256 NAPI channels are being used
   (across all adapters on the server; partly determined by the sfc module
   parameter "rss_cpus").
 ~ This has been seen to cause:
    - general protection fault in efx_stop_all+0x38a/0x5a0.
    - kernel NULL pointer dereference in napi_hash_add+0x59/0xc0.

[Stratus ftServer support] - Note these issues only affect PCI hot-plug cases:
Issue 67007:
 ~ Fix race between efx_pci_remove_main() and efx_irq_notify().
Issue 61922:
 ~ Hold RTNL while we modify the CPU channel map.


### v4.10.0.1011 -- Intermediate release as part of openonload-201606-u1
[General changes]
 ~ GA release of acceleration for overlay networks, VxLAN / NV-GRE / GENEVE
   (previously beta)
 ~ Check MTU against minimum threshold.
 ~ Better detection of BIOS/kernel failing to provide addresses for PCI BARs.

Issue 66869 (ESX only):
 ~ Fix a race in the admin side of MCDI proxy authorization.
 ~ The error message reported would be of the form:
     efx_proxy_auth_handle_request: invalid req state 5 

Issue 65427:
 ~ Correctly report UDP RSS hashing mode as 2-tuple (address only) or 4-tuple
   (address and port)  with "ethtool -n <intf> rx-flow-hash udp4"

Issue 65511:
 ~ Avoid kernel warning from efx_ef10_ev_process() when the sfc.ko module
   parameter forward_fcs=1, as CRCs should be ignored in this case.

Issue 65013:
 ~ An interaction with the kernel stack can lead to no traffic being transmitted
   if a very small (less than 68) MTU is set. The driver will now reject such
   configurations as invalid.

Issue 64919:
 ~ Fix crash seen in efx_pci_probe_main() when sf-boot pf-count was altered and
   the driver was reloaded.

Issue 64574/65176 (SFN8XXX only):
 ~ Packets with transmit timestamps with the xmit_more flag (set by the kernel
   queuing discipline)  could be delayed before transmission, causing missing
   packet reports from PTP daemons. In unusual cases this could lead to
   TX watchdog timeouts.
 ~ The sfptpd error message reported would be of the form:
      sfptpd: retrieved transmit timestamp but no packet
      kernel: sfc 0000:82:00.1 sfc1: TX queue 4 spurious TX completion id 1a


### v4.9.0.1016 -- GA release adding support for SFN8542 adapters.

Please note that network interface names may change across this driver update.
See issue 64065 below.

Support for stateless checksum offloads for NVGRE,VXLAN,GENEVE encapsulation on
SFN8XXX adapters is still considered a BETA at this time.

[General changes]
 ~ Fail gracefully when PCIe BARs are unassigned (better detection of BIOS
   issues which have been seen after a PCI bus rescan).
 ~ Add support for software TX timestamping.

[SFN8000 series support]
 ~ Add support for "ethtool -C stats-block-usecs".
   Default is 1 sec, but this can be reduced in order to accurately sample every
   second from a script.

[overlays support]
 ~ Add encap TNI to debugfs filter dump.
 ~ Set UDP tunnel port list (for GENEVE and VxLAN) on driver load. This may
   cause the microcontroller on the adapter to reboot in order to reprogram
   some elements in the adapter datapath.

Issue 64478:
 ~ In firmware-variant=low-latency if there are more than 256 multicast filter
   subscriptions then use multicast promiscuous.

Issue 64065:
 ~ Stop setting dev_port and instead implement get_phys_port_id for PFs. This
   makes network interface names assigned by systemd more consistent with other
   network drivers e.g. enp130s0f1d1 becomes enp130s0f1.

Issue 64013:
 ~ Correct a kernel WARNING in skb_checksum_help() when using TSO over a VLAN
   over a bond. The error message seen would be:
     WARNING: at net/core/dev.c:1907 skb_warn_bad_offload+0xc2/0xf0()
   This issue was introduced between v4.7.0.1035 and .1036.

Issue 63865:
 ~ Fix checking of PTP license when interface is taken down and then up. This
   would affect MCFW <v6 on SFN7XXX  when running sfptpd or ptp4l. The error
   message seen would be:
     warning: received Sync with no timestamp

Issue 63820:
 ~ Improve clean up after "ethtool -t" self-test failure.

Issue 63587:
 ~ Fix crash seen with EnterpriseOnload v4 at driver/linux_net/ef10.c:4484
   in efx_ef10_filter_get_unsafe_id(). This was found in an internal test case
   that exhausted hardware filters and is believed to be highly unlikely in a
   customer deployment.

Issue 63467:
 ~ Limit TX ring to 2048 descriptors for SFN7XXX and SFN8XXX adapters.
   Previously it was possible to get a WARNING from efx_ef10_tx_init() by using:
     ethtool -G <interface name> tx 4096

Issue 63389:
 ~ Prevent allocating a PTP interrupt in some cases where it is not required.

Issue 62350:
 ~ Only claim checksum offload for encapsulation types that SFN8XXX hardware
   can handle (GENEVE, VXLAN, NVGRE).

Issue 61338:
 ~ Fix for VFs being broken after sfupdate was run while onload stacks were
   constructed.
   The error message seen would be:
     resetting (DATAPATH)
     failed to restore vswitching rc=-71, VFs may not function
     unable to restore all filters


### v4.8.4.1000 -- GA release for ESXi adding support for SFN8522 adapters.
[SFN8522 support]
 ~ GA support for ESXi and SFN8522 Solarflare adapters.
 ~ Please note that VXLAN acceleration for ESXi, including VXLAN IOVP
   certification, will follow in a future driver update.


### v4.8.2.1004 -- GA release adding support for SFN8522 adapters.
[SFN8522 support]
 ~ GA support for SFN8522 Solarflare adapters, to match all features of the
   SFN7XXX series including SR-IOV and NIC partitioning.
 ~ Support for more efficient TSO on SFN8XXX adapters.
 ~ Use a symmetric RSS hash by default.
   This is most useful when sniffing both sides of a TCP conversation. This
   ensures that all packets are directed to the same RX queue and all are
   handled in-order.
 ~ Add "tso_version" and "csum_offload" to TX queue information in debugfs.
 ~ Attach hardware RX timestamps to SKBs in GRO and LRO code-paths.
 ~ Support IPv6 flow-steering in ethtool rxnfc API (still needs support in
   ethtool)
 ~ Support encap-over-IPv6 in ethtool n-tuple API (still needs support in
   ethtool)
 ~ Support for SKB xmit_more flags in compatible kernels.
 ~ Change to use the 4-tuple UDP RSS hashing, as the resulting hash value will
   help improve GRO performance.
 ~ Read adadpter PCIe configuration to warn on PCIe lane width or speed not
   being optimal for the adapter in use.
 ~ Use 4K PIO buffers on SFN8XXX adapters.
 ~ Adds a module parameter "performance_profile" to allow selection of
   broad tuning options, allowing selection of low latency ('latency') or
   high throughput ('throughput') profiles. The default is 'auto', in
   which the profile is selected based off licensed options on the adapter.
   At present this only changes the event queue initialization options on 8000
   series adapters.

[BETA quality support for stateless checksum offloads for NVGRE,VXLAN,GENEVE
encapsulation on SFN8XXX adapters]
 ~ Support for checksum offloads in the presense of encapsulation/
   overlay networks (tunnels) on SFN8XXX hardware. Outer frames of (NV)GRE /
   VxLAN / GENEVE are supported. Linux native tunnels and OVS will utilise this
   checksum offload.
 ~ Add support for encapsulated TSO for 8000 series adapters.
 ~ Add message when adapter resets due to VXLAN port list change.
 ~ Add debugfs entry "vxlan_ports" to print the list of VXLAN ports.

[onload]
Issue 62104:
 ~ More conservatively account for the number of wakeup events that the driver
   might have to handle, one for each possible onload stack. This prevents
   event queue overflows in rare cases.

[EF-VI support]
 ~ Do not treat a broadcast filter as exclusive in filter logic.
   This prevented ef_vi from installing >1 UDP filter with the local IP set
   to broadcast.

[Stratus ftServer support]
Issue 57944:
 ~ Take a read lock on the filter table when performing driverlink (onload/EFVI)
   operations on filters; as there was a possible NULL pointer dereference if
   there was a race with PCIe hot-plug.

[General fixes]
Issue 62086:
 ~ On MC reset (e.g. running sfupdate or ethtool -t offline tests), clear PIO
   buffer linkage in TXQs. Otherwise, if we fail to allocate new PIO buffers,
   TXQs will try to use the old deallocated PIO buffers and this will cause an
   error.

Issue 58215:
 ~ Remove suprious WARNING from efx_hard_start_xmit() seen after "ethtool -t"
   off-line self-tests. Use of "ethtool -t" can be identified from
   "MC entered BIST mode" in the kernel log.

Issue 57217:
 ~ Fix taking the network interface into promiscuous (or allmulti) mode when
   running with low-latency firmware variant.
     i.e "sfboot firmware-variant=ultra-low-latency".
   The error message seen would be:
     Unicast mismatch filter insert failed rc=-93
     Multicast mismatch filter insert failed rc=-93

Issue 41741:
 ~ Implement shutdown() driver entry point. This helps quiesce the Solarflare
   adapter when using kexec to transition to a new kernel. This issue was seen
   on IBM POWER machines that raised EEH errors during the kexec.

Issue 33781:
 ~ "ethtool -S" statistic "port_rx_bad_bytes" was not being correctly reset in
   all cases.

### v4.7.1.1000 -- Update release
[General changes]
 ~ Build fixes for linux 4.5 kernels.
 ~ Provide an option to place external network port PHY into power down when the
   network interface is administratively down. This means the link partner also
   sees link down. Currently this is controlled via an ethtool private flag:
    - To enable/disable:
       ethtool --set-priv-flags DEVNAME phy-power-follows-link (on|off)
    - To show current state:
       ethtool --show-priv-flags DEVNAME
 ~ support IPv6 flow steering (needs ethtool support that is not yet released).

Issue 53130
 ~ Create MTD partitions (to allow sfupdate) even if NVRAM metadata cannot
    be successfully read.

[Stratus ftServer support]
Issue 60796:
 ~ Fix efx_mcdi_acquire_sync() returning -ETIMEDOUT on impolite unplug.

### v4.7.0.1049 -- Update release for EOL 4
Issue 65013:
 ~ Upstream kernel 4.10 centralised checking of minimum and maximum MTU values.
   In kernels without this checking the kernel doesn't handle small MTUs
   correctly, so we introduce a check for overly small MTU - the new minimum is
   68 bytes.

### v4.7.0.1048 -- Update release for EOL 4
Issue 72220:
  ~ [32bit PHC support]. Fix bug in efx_phc_gettime32() that returns junk time.
  ~ This only affects systems without 64bit PHC support e.g. some SLES11
    (kernel 3.0.101)

Issue 73143:
 ~ Fixed reading of ef10 data on non-ef10 NIC (i.e. SFN5000 or SFN6000 series)
 ~ This was detected using KASAN by Stefano Brivio at Redhat:
      BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in efx_mcdi_mac_stats

Issue 72328:
 ~ Fix possible overflow of unicast address list. e.g. by configuration of a
   32nd macvlan interface all on the same network interface. The error was of
   the form:
     WARNING: at driver/linux_net/ef10.c:7032 efx_ef10_filter_insert_addr_list+0x4d2/0x510 [sfc]()

### v4.7.0.1046 -- Update release for EOL 3

Please note that network interface names may change across this driver update.
See issue 64065 below.

[General changes]
 ~ Build fixes for linux 4.10 kernels.
 ~ Build fixes for RHEL 7.4 kernels.
 ~ Provide an option to place external network port PHY into power down when the
   network interface is administratively down. This means the link partner also
   sees link down. Currently this is controlled via an ethtool private flag:
    - To enable/disable:
       ethtool --set-priv-flags DEVNAME phy-power-follows-link (on|off)
    - To show current state:
       ethtool --show-priv-flags DEVNAME

[SFN8522 support]
 ~ Support IPv6 flow-steering in ethtool rxnfc API (still needs support in
   ethtool)
 ~ Support encap-over-IPv6 in ethtool n-tuple API (still needs support in
   ethtool)

Issue 69569:
 ~ Fix timestamp being 1s behind if the minor nanosecond timestamp happened to
   be exactly on 0.

Issue 67994:
 ~ Fix for pps_get_ts() only returning microsecond resolution with RHEL 7.2.
 ~ (Note this did not affect other RHEL 7.X releases).
 ~ This would affect the PTP convergence accuracy that is achieved.

Issue 64065:
 ~ Stop setting dev_port and instead implement get_phys_port_id for PFs. This
   makes network interface names assigned by systemd more consistent with other
   network drivers e.g. enp130s0f1d1 becomes enp130s0f1.


### v4.7.0.1035 -- Update release

[General changes]
 ~ expose SFA7942Q flash partitions via MTD (to speed up sfupdate)
 ~ Include Stratus ftServer improvements from v4.5.1.1037
 ~ Use timespec64 if available for y2038 compatibility.

Issue 59734:
 ~ Fix detection of PHC so that /dev/ptp* is registered on SLES11/12

Issue 59701 & 58885:
 ~ Take the mac_lock in efx_ef10_sriov_set_vf_mac()
   This fixes a kernel panic in efx_ef10_filter_vlan_sync_rx_mode() when
   using SR-IOV direct pass-thru mode.


### v4.7.0.1031 -- Feature release 

[General changes]
 ~ Support adapter firmware state dump via ethtool.
 ~ Set IRQ interrupt hints for 3.x kernels. The irqbalance service using
   policy=strict will follow these hints.
 ~ NAPI budget now only applies to receive processing (previously TX completion
   and other internal events were incorrectly counted towards the budget).
 ~ Use symmetric RSS hash key by default. This allows applications such as IDS
   to ensure that both directions of a TCP stream will be spread via RSS to
   the same channel.
 ~ Implement VLAN filtering. (only on full-featured adapter firmware variant)

[SR-IOV]
 ~ Implement sriov_set_vf_spoofchk() for SFN7XXX adapters.

[Performance]
 ~ Automatically configure XPS at driver load (on kernels where this is
   supported).
 ~ Implement IRQ notifiers so that XPS can match any changes to interrupt
   affinity.
 ~ Report TX completions to BQL after all TX events from an interrupt/NAPI poll.
   This gives a significant improvement to UDP transaction rates using RHEL7 or
   SLES12 kernels.
 ~ read EVQ in cache line batches.
 ~ allocate rx pages on the same node as the interrupt.
 ~ Improve performance when the driver is asked to add/strip VLAN tags for
   linux kernels >=3.0.

[General VMware ESXi support]
Issue 43845:
  ~ Avoid installation of duplicate default unicast and multicast Rx filters.
Issue 57409:
  ~ Disable RSS by default ('num_rss_netqs' module parameter with value greater
    than zero may be used to enable RSS on specified number of NetQueues).

[Support SR-IOV on VMware ESXi 5.5 and 6.0]
First release supporting SR-IOV on VMware ESXi (SFN7xxx adapters only).
This support requires sfutils >=v4.7.0.1004 which contains adapter firmware
v4.7.0.1019 and firmware-variant=full-feature (setup with sfboot).
See chapter "SR-IOV Virtualization Using ESXi" of the "Solarflare Server
Adapter User's Guide".
  ~ Support 'max_vfs' module parameter to request specified number of VFs
    for each PF.
  ~ Enforce PF promiscuous mode if VFs are requested (required on ESXi 5.5 only
    since ESXi 6.0 enforces this itself).
  ~ Support VF MAC address configuration; security settings of the port group
    that the VM network interface belongs to should be used to control it.
  ~ Support VF default VLAN tagging done by the NIC.
  ~ Support VF anti-spoofing control configured as "allow/deny forged
    transmits" in security settings of the port group the VM network interface
    belongs to.
  ~ Support reading VF statistics from the hypervisor (for example,
    esxcli network sriovnic vf stats -n vmnic2 -v 0).
  ~ Support MTU change requested on VF, if allowed by hypervisor. This is
    configurable in VM network interface settings.
  ~ Support VF promiscuous mode, if allowed by hypervisor (ESXi 6.0 only).
  ~ Support VF VLAN membership control by hypervisor; only untagged traffic
    is allowed by default.

Issue 51699:
 ~ Fix lockdep warning on driver unload.

Issue 56887:
  ~ Fix memory leak for EFX_MCDI_REQUEST private ioctl calls e.g. from sfupdate.

Issue 56934:
  ~ avoid rx copybreak on GRO tail packet to avoid potential reordering.


### v4.5.1.1038 -- Update release

[Stratus ftServer support]
Issue 59975:
  ~ Add workaround for loss of RX doorbell in a "breaker" test.

### v4.5.1.1037 -- Update release

[General changes]
  ~ Support for linux v4.3
  ~ Simplify locking when CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL is enabled (~20ns latency win)
  ~ Make RSS hashing symmetric by default.
    The key chosen has been shown to provide good spreading as well as being
    symmetric. Symmetry is important for applications that sniff both
    directions of TCP conversations (eg. IDS and other security apps).
  ~ Support for Solarflare SFA7942Q QSFP+ AOE Adapter (but please use
    specific packages that are targeted at this adapter).

Issue 55559:
  ~ Cleanup IRQ affinity hints correctly in probe failure path which
    caused this warning:
    "WARNING: at kernel/irq/manage.c:1221 __free_irq+0x19a/0x1e0()"

Issue 56887:
  ~ Fix small memory leak on every EFX_MCDI_REQUEST private ioctl call.

Issue 56934:
  ~ Avoid rx copybreak on GRO tail packet.
  ~ If a fragmented TCP packet is being handled by GRO, rx copybreak should not
    be used on any small tail fragment as this can result in packets being
    delivered out of order. These small fragments could benefit from
    reassembly in GRO if part of a stream of larger packets.

[OpenOnload support]
Issue 57548:
  ~ IPv4 broadcast address should not be treated as exclusive.
  ~ this allows ef_vi to install >1 UDP filters with a local broadcast IP.

[Stratus ftServer OpenOnload support]
  ~ Further work to strengthen driver robustness on surprise device
    removal; especially when OpenOnload is being used.
Issue 53701:
  ~ Support changing MAC address with filters installed.
    This is required for OpenOnload to add new slaves to a bond.


### v4.5.1.1026 -- Update release

[General changes]
  ~ Support for linux v4.2.
  ~ Make locking between NAPI and busy-polling less expensive.

[Stratus ftServer support]
  ~ Further work to remove warnings if device isolation and fail-over occurs.
  ~ Fix infinite loop in efx_pause_napi() on module unload if onload is being
    used and a hardware fault causes the driver to enter a disabled state.

Issue 54445:
  ~ Address "NOHZ: local_softirq_pending 08" seen on sfc.ko module unload.

Issue 54748:
  ~ When sfc.ko module parameters rss_numa_local=1 and rss_cpus is
    greater than the number of logical CPUs on a node, remove the false
    limitation that onload could only use interrupts on the local NUMA node.

Issue 54840:
  ~ Fix efx_ef10_filter_is_exclusive() which did not identify the ethertype and
    IP-protocol filters as exclusive.

Issue 55443:
  ~ Fix rare case where after several failed attempts to allocate memory (in
    order to refill the RX descriptor ring) the driver did not continue to
    retry. This causes the ethtool stat "rx_nodesc_drops" to increase.

Issue 56015:
  ~ Fix potential NULL pointer deference in efx_mcdi_mon_remove().


### v4.5.1.1020 -- Update release

Issue 50755:
  ~ Fix serious page reference counting issue relating to the RX recycle ring.
  ~ For full details please see the following known issue on the Solarflare
    support site where you can also sign up for e-mail notifications
    <https://support.solarflare.com/index.php?option=com_cognidox&file=SF-114768-KI-2_Serious_page_reference_counting_issue_in_Linux_network_driver.htm&Itemid=24&catid=3011&view=embed&id=3013>

Issue 53778:
  ~ Resolve deadlock when setting VF VLAN via "ip link" command.

Issue 54347:
  ~ Add legacy method for changing a PF's MAC address.
  ~ This restores compatability with Solarflare adapter firmware <= 4.1.1.1023


### v4.5.1.1010 -- Feature release

[General changes]
  ~ Kernel compat support for v4.0.0.
  ~ Support ethtool filters on IP protocol.
  ~ Allow setting and querying the RSS hash key through ethtool interface.
  ~ Implement ethtool -l|--show-channels.
  ~ Add known good default RSS (Topelitz) key (vs. using a random key) and add a
    module parameter 'rss_use_fixed_key' (default:1)
  ~ Rework allocation of TX queues to allow driver to take advantage of
    upcoming firmware performance improvements on SFN7142Q adapters in 2*40G
    mode.

[Stratus ftServer support]
   ~ Introduce support for Stratus ftServers (including polite and impolite
     removal cases). Driver module parameter 'monitor_interval_ms'
     (default 200ms) is used to test see if a PCIe isolation event has occurred.
   ~ Please use the version of the driver that is supplied by Stratus that has
     been fully qualified for your ftServer.

[General fixes]
Issue 52542:
   ~ Fix rare 'kernel BUG at include/linux/skbuff.h:1485 in efx_rx_mk_skb+0x418/0x440'
     seen with RHEL7 by filling the skb_cache before initialising the Rx queue.
Issue 52296:
   ~ Add timeout in efx_mcdi_acquire_sync() and print a warning on failure.
Issue 44816:
  ~ Fix possible ARFS duplicate flows with the same ID causing the error
    'MC command 0x8a inlen 12 failed rc=-22 (raw=22) arg=2' by tracking
    RPS flow IDs per channel instead of per function

[PTP fixes]
Issue 47477:
   ~ If adapter has no PTP license then display "no PTP support" instead of the
     obscure message "MC command 0xb failed".
Issue 45960:
   ~ fix sfptpd warnings seen when SolarCapture started with ptp=1 and then
     exited by correcting RX filter insertion actions required in this use-case.

[Onload fixes]
Issue 52368:
  ~ [onload] disable and re-enable NAPI more safely during driverlink
    unregister.
Issue 52324:
  ~ [onload] Fix NULL pointer dereference in Onload efrm_pd_alloc() after
    passing a device into a VM guest.
Issue 51102:

### v4.2.2.1016 -- Feature release

First release supporting NIC partitioning, SR-IOV and PF-IOV modes on SFN7XXX
adapters. This support requires sfutils >=v4.3.0.1010 which contains adapter
firmware v4.2.1.1014 and firmware-variant=full-feature (setup with sfboot)

General changes:
  ~ the old module parameter "enable_multi_pf" has been removed as NIC
    partitioning (with multiple PFs) is now fully supported by this driver
  ~ add sysfs entry and module parameter to control MCDI tracing between
    the driver and the adapter firmware. This is an extra debug feature that is
    for the use of Solarflare support.

Issue 44671:
  ~ Work around TRIGGER_INTERRUPT command not being supported on SFN7142Q.
Issue 44372:
  ~ Disable RSS on packed stream firmware variant (used for SolarCapture) as it
    is not supported
Issue 44737:
  ~ Increase BIST mode timeout from 10s to 30s to accommodate longer SFN7142Q
    BIST operations.
Issue 46845:
  ~ remove bogus __GFP_COLD flag in page allocation to improve performance.
Issue 47102:
  ~ replace get_page() with atomic_set() to improve performance.
Issue 44509:
  ~ PTP. Fix logical error in efx_ptp_restart()
Issue 44510:
  ~ PTP. To increase robustness, efx_ptp_change_mode() should always disable
    PTP in the firmware if disable is requested even if the driver believes that
    PTP is already stopped
Issue 47551:
  ~ Only fallback to lower interrupt mode if the lower mode is supported.
Issue 47169:
  ~ Kernel compat fixes for RHEL 6.6
Issue 47339:
  ~ Kernel compat for linux 3.16.
Issue 47268:
  ~ Allow for a smaller RX ring to be configured (minimum of 128 reduced to 16)
Issue 47603:
  ~ Move selection of SXPS from compile time to run time.


### v4.1.2.1003 -- Feature release

New features to support the SolarCapture 1.3 release:
   ~ New forward_fcs attribute in sysfs which when enabled, causes the driver to
     not strip CRCs on ingress path. When enabled frames with bad CRCs are not 
     discarded. Changing forward_fcs requires reconfiguring the adapter's MAC
   ~ Disable ARFS if the required adapter filter flags are not supported
   ~ Disable RSS on Packed Stream firmware variant
Other new features:
   ~ Add sysfs entry to control MCDI tracing
   ~ Add module parameter to enable MCDI logging on new functions

Issue 45309:
   ~ Take mac_lock when setting or unsetting the kernel block (from EFVI or
     onload) in order to avoid races in sync_rx_mode.
Issue 44095:
   ~ change EFX_BUG_ON_PARANOID on mcdi failure in ptp_synchronize to a proper
     error path.
Issue 43849:

   ~ handle nonlinear SKBs in efx_filter_rfs() 
Issue 45444:
   ~ fix calling of free_irq with already free vector 
Issue 40785:
   ~ add module option "underreport_skb_truesize" to falsify skb->truesize for
     LRO packets 
Issue 43391:
   ~ use __GFP_NOWARN when allocating RX pages from atomic context.
Issue 44829:
   ~ don't BUG_ON efx->max_channels == 0 in probe
Issue 46587:
   ~ Add RW semaphore to protect against MCDI timeouts in
     efx_ef10_filter_table_remove() which could cause a kernel panic in
     efx_ef10_filter_table_restore(). There should not be MCDI timeouts seen
     in production systems so this is a defensive fix rather than a bug fix.


### v4.1.0.6734B -- Update release for VMware ESXi

Issue 51531:
  ~ Some ethtool operations could cause an RTNL deadlock. This could be
    experienced when running ethtool from the command line or if openmanage
    is installed. This can cause a hang when the adapters page is opened in
    vSphere.


### v4.1.0.6734A -- Update release for VMware ESXi

Issue 44988:
  ~ Use receive ring with 512 entries by default to consume less packet buffers.
  ~ Change default number of NetQueues from 4 to 8.
Issue 46436:
  ~ If available, put RSS hash information to skb.


### v4.1.0.6734 -- Feature release

New Features:
  ~ Add support for busy polling available in Linux 3.11.
    See section 1.8 of http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.11
    Note that only connect()'ed sockets can make use of this latency reducing
    feature.
  ~ Implement SARFS; Solarflare Accelerated Receive Flow Steering
    (disabled by default) This inserts hardware RX filters in order to direct
    flows back to the same CPU where the user-land process is transmitted. This 
    should help cache locality.
    This feature can be used when Accelerated RFS is not available in the
    currently running kernel, and if ARFS is in use will be disabled.
    To enable SARFS, set the "sarfs_sample_rate module" parameter to non-zero.
    20 is recommended.
    In addition, some form of XPS is needed for SARFS to function correctly. The
    easiest way to do this is to enable Solarflare XPS by setting the module
    parameter "sxps_enabled=1"
    Alternatively if your kernel supports it you can enable XPS by following the
    instructions at:
      https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/scaling.txt
    or in the Solarflare Adapter User Guide (SF-103837-CD) 
      section 3.20 Performance Tuning on Linux
  ~ 7xxx: Add support for SFC9140 40G QSFP network controller silicon.
    (network adapter part number SFN7142Q).
  ~ Preferentially affinitise interrupts to CPUs on the NUMA node local to the
    adapter and restrict RSS to only local CPUs (disabled by default).
    To enable this feature set the module parameter "rss_numa_local=1"
  ~ add RX hook for driverlink to allow Solarsecure Filter Engine to inspect
    packets.

PTP issues/features:
Issue 35011: 
  ~ PTP: Use net_ratelimit() for PTP event queue overflow messages.
Issue 41277: 
  ~ PTP: Advertise translated hardware timestamps.
Issue 41479:

    packets is enabled in the NIC. This allows phc2sys to be used without
    requiring linuxptp to be running
Issue 42466: 
 ~ PTP: check for NULL efx->ptp_data in efx_ptp_event
Issue 42956:
  ~ PTP: Test for ethtool get_ts_info support directly
Issue 41055:
  ~ PTP: Check for non-PTP or non-primary function in private clock ioctls
  ~ In some cases this could cause a kernel NULL pointer dereference in
    efx_ptp_ts_settime() when calling ioctl(SIOCSHWTSTAMP)
Issue 41022:
  ~ PTP: Fix kernel NULL pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmit() that could
    be caused if hardware timestamping on raw sockets were enabled.
Issue 40999:
  ~ PTP: Expose ptp_caps on primary function, not all functions on port 0
Issue 42321:
  ~ 7xxx: PTP. Fix issue that can cause firmware watchdog to expire while host
    compares system and NIC clocks.

Driver support for OpenOnload / EFVI / SolarSecure Filtering Engine:

  ~ onload: multicast loopback: net_driver filter support
  ~ onload: net_driver filter support for stack_id
Issue 41295:

Issue 40373:
  ~ rewrite pcie_enable_error_reporting error to be less alarming
    (normally when AER cannot be enabled as the platform firmware is handling
    this)
Issue 39820:
  ~ Don't count discarded packets as checksum errors as well.
Issue 39528:
  ~ Improve 'Fatal error' logs which occur when MC reboot is detected
Issue 43431:

### v4.0.2.6640 -- VMware ESXi feature release

Support VMware ESXi 5.5:
  ~ Support SFN5xxx/SFN6xxx and SFN7xxx.
  ~ Support VLAN tagging on transmit and stripping on receive in driver.
  ~ Support paired NetQueue feature which says that transmit and receive
    NetQueues with the same number share event queue/interrupt.
  ~ Support dynamic NetQueue feature which allows dynamically allocalte
    NetQueue with specified features.
  ~ Support RSS NetQueue feature.
  ~ Support preemptible NetQueue feature which allows to reallocation of
    a NetQueue with different features.
  ~ Support dynamic RSS NetQueue feature which allows ESXi kernel to
    configure RSS hash key and indirection table.
  ~ Remove 'rss_vlans' module parameter since RSS NetQueue feature is supported.
  ~ Support 'netq_force_rss' module parameter to enforce RSS on all applicable
    NetQueues.
  ~ Support 'num_rss_netqs' module parameter to control number of NetQueues
    with RSS support (one by default on ESXi 5.1 and newer version, zero on
    earlier versions).
  ~ Support LRO and corresponding NetQueue feature which allows to control LRO
    enabled/disabled when NetQueue is allocated.
  ~ Support 'netq_force_lro' module parameter to force LRO on all NetQueues
    including default one.

### v4.0.2.6628.1 -- Hot-fix release
  ~ use 64-bit writes for PIO as 32bit PIO writes to write-combined mappings
    can, in very rare circumstances cause data corruption (before TCP checksum
    offload occurs).
    Restrict PIO to x86_64 systems.


### v4.0.2.6628 -- Feature release

Add support for RX time-stamping and PTP on SFN7XXX family adapters:
   ~ This release provides the driver support necessary for both the 
     Solarflare Enhanced PTP daemon ("sfptpd") and linuxptpd which is 
     provided in some distributions.

Issue 37568:
  ~ Properly deliver VLAN-tagged PTP packets when disabling PTP.
Issue 39894:
  ~ Fix DMA unmapping of incorrect addresses for TSO TX buffers on SFN7XXX
    family adapters.
    This bug would be observed as unmap page errors, and would affect users with
    TSO (enabled by default) and an IOMMU enabled.
Issue 38352:
  ~ Remove build time warning message when MTD is disabled, as sfutils can now
    work on linux using an IOCTL to the driver.


### v4.0.0.6585 -- Feature release

Support for SFN7XXX family adapters (using SFC91XX family silicon):
  ~ This release contains full GA quality support for the new SFN7XXX series of
    network adapters.
  ~ Currently running PTP on SFN7XXX adapters is not supported. This support
    will be in a subsequent release in 2013Q4.
  ~ There are new counters exposed via "ethtool -S" to expose any new internal
    packet counters.
  ~ driver support for the "sfkey" utility to modify feature licenses on the
    adapter.

TX improvements:
  ~ Support for SFC91XX TX PIO (Programmed IO) feature for lower TX latency.
    This is controlled by the new module parameter "piobuf_size" (default on
    x86 is 256 bytes). For frames that are smaller than this, and if there are
    adapter resources available, a packet will be transfered directly to the
    adapter via PIO rather than incur the latency of a bus mastered DMA. 

RX improvements:
  ~ The driver now uses a single optimized RX buffer allocation strategy
    (the "rx_alloc_method" module parameter has been deprecated and has no
    effect other than to print a warning).
  ~ Use memory more efficiently by supporting RX scatter for large MTU values
  ~ Make initial fill of RX descriptors synchronous. This is to avoid a non-zero
    "rx_nodesc_drops" count which could previously increment during driver load
    when there was incoming traffic.

Support for POWER systems, including:
  ~ AER/EEH support in the net driver
  ~ Improve performance by reusing DMA-mapped pages
  ~ Improve performance by allocating RX buffers more efficiently in pages of
    memory

Ethtool offline self-test behaviour for SFN7XXX:
  ~ For SFN7XXX series adapters the ethtool offline selftest (which can be used
    to verify hardware operation) can cause operations on other network
    interfaces on the same adapter to fail (as the whole adapter goes into a
    test mode). Only run the ethtool offline self-test on one port at a time,
    and expect to see loss of link for the duration of the test on all ports.
    Note the ethtool online test does not have this limitation.

Issue 39031:
  ~ Remove ethtool RESET operation that could be used by an unpriviledged local
    user to cause a local denial of service.
Issue 31933:
  ~ Cancel interrupt self-test on interface-down on Linux <2.6.23
Issue 36071:
  ~ Avoid kernel warning in skb_try_coalesce
Issue 34973:
  ~ Fix RX buffer handling on non-x86 and non-POWER systems
Issue 35013:
  ~ Fix potential kernel panic when using certain (uncommon) MTU values
Issue 35019:
  ~ Fix build failure on RHEL5 kernel

Issue 16820:
  ~ Detach network device during reconfiguration to avoid TX watchdog event
Issue 34335:
  ~ Fix driver load failure due to symbols exported on some kernel versions


### v3.3.3.6329 -- Update release

Issue 38482:
  ~ Fix issue in dealing with multicast mismatch present in v3.3.0.6262, which
   was caused by the fix for Issue 31533. This could cause old packet data to
   be received (and hence could look like packet loss, or out-of-order
   packets).

   The bug hits when the following events coincide:
    1) The arrival of a frame that is discarded by the driver.
    2) The receiving channel is in "page-mode" for RX buffer allocation.
    3) The previous packet received has been consumed and freed.

   By default the RX allocation mode is selected automatically by the
   driver according to the traffic profile, and will prefer page-mode when
   packets that can be handled by kernel GRO dominate.

   A workaround for affected drivers is to set the driver parameter
   "rx_alloc_method=1" (to force SKB based allocations).

### v3.1.0.4047

Performance:

  - TX push: reduces TX latency 
  - Write-combining: reduces TX latency (dependent on kernel version)
  - RX hash insertion: allows faster flow lookup in software
  - Driver structures reorganised for improved cache locality

Features:

  - SR-IOV support: host-side support for accelerated guest networking in 
    KVM and Xen 
  - RX n-tuple support: use 'ethtool -U' or 'sfctool -U' as an alternative to
    the sfc_affinity module
  - Soft-TSO statistics: included in statistics reported by 'ethtool -S'
  - Driver logging control: for diagnostic purposes, 
    use 'ethtool -s ethX msglvl ...' to enable and disable messages
  - Register dump support: for diagnostic purposes, 
    use 'ethtool -d' to dump register state
