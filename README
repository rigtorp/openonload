Documentation
=============

 The Onload User Guide is available to customers with supported cards.  You
 can register and download a copy from: https://support.solarflare.com/.

 You may also find the Solarstorm User Guide useful -- it is available from
 the same place.


Quick start
===========

 If deploying Onload from a tarball, then the following command will
 build and install the Onload drivers into system directories (as root).
 For instructions on other Onload installation packages (e.g. source RPM),
 please refer to the Onload user guide.

   <top>/scripts/onload_install

 You may need to reload the drivers if you have drivers loaded already:

   onload_tool reload

 Or to load the Onload and sfc drivers if none are loaded:

   modprobe sfc

 You may need to configure your ethernet interface with an IP address using
 the standard tools.  Please see the documentation that comes with your
 Linux distribution for details.

 To accelerate an application with the Onload user-level transport, simply
 invoke the application on the command line as normal, prepended with
 "onload".

 ie. Instead of:

   netperf -t TCP_RR -H myserver

 do this:

   onload netperf -t TCP_RR -H myserver

 and tuned for best latency:

   onload -p latency netperf -t TCP_RR -H myserver


Configuration and tuning
========================

 Onload takes many configuration settings directly from the kernel stack.
 In addition, there are a number of configuration and tuning options that
 can be set via environment variables.  See the Onload User Guide for
 details.

 You can get detailed descriptions of the configuration options in the
 version of Onload that you are using by running the following command:

   onload_stackdump doc
