/* efrink.h
 *
 * Library for shared memory ring
 *
 * This is an advanced technique which has the potential to provide a more
 * efficient way to receive data when multiple consumer processes want to
 * receive the same data stream(s) from the network.
 *
 * A single controller (e.g. efrink_controller) sets up a region of shared
 * memory and posts chunks of this to the RX ring of the NIC. As the NIC writes
 * packet data, it returns completion events. The controller receives these
 * events and marks each packet buffer as complete.
 *
 * One or more readers (e.g. efrink_consumer) can access the shared memory to
 * read the packets. The data is protected via a generation counter.
 *
 * Consumers must:
 * 1. call read_begin() to wait for packet data to arrive
 * 2. read data from the packet buffer. Note that the data could get
 *    overwritten during the read, so any action taken should be reversible
 * 3. use is_read_valid() to check that the generation counter is unchanged. If
 *    this returns true the read was valid and the action can be finalised
 *    (e.g. by sending a response). If this returns false, the consumer can
 *    retry the read to get new data.
