 * This function delegates sends to the application.
 * It reserves up to @p max_delegated_wnd bytes for future
 * delegated sends, and returns the Ethernet-IP-TCP headers.  The maximum
 * amount of data that the application can send is then returned in
 * ds->delegated_wnd.  Both @p max_delegated_wnd and ds->delegated_wnd are
 * relative to sends already completed.
 *
 * If @p cong_wnd_override is non-zero, it specifies a minimum congestion
 * window.  This call behaves as if the congestion window is the larger of
 * @p cong_wnd_override and the zocket's actual congestion window.
 *
 * Once a send has been completed, call zf_delegated_send_complete() to
 * indicate how many bytes were used, and make further calls to this
 * function to extend the window for delegated sends.
 *
 * If not all the bytes reserved with this call are used then
 * zf_delegated_send_cancel() must be called before further normal sends.
 * A subsequent call to zf_delegated_send_prepare() is safe without calling
 * zf_delegated_send_cancel().
 *
 * When the return code is RC_OK, RC_NOWIN or RC_NOCWIN, the headers
 * and other fields in @p ds are initialised.  This set is indicated
 * by !(rc & ZF_DELEGATED_SEND_RC_FATAL).  When RC_SMALL_HEADER is
 * returned, ds->headers_len is initialised.  In other cases @p ds is
 * not filled in.
 *
 * Note that the delegated window is never reduced by this call, so
 * ds->delegated_wnd may be non-zero even if RC_NOWIN or RC_NOCWIN is
 * returned.
